# ðŸ§  Sentiment Analyser using Naive Bayes

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** on product reviews using **Naive Bayes classification**. It classifies each review as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**. The project includes a clean preprocessing pipeline, model training with TF-IDF vectorization, and optional UI using **Gradio**.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Source:** [Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)
- **Size:** 568,454 reviews

## ðŸ§ª Preprocessing

- Lowercasing text  
- Removing punctuation  
- Removing stopwords  
- Token filtering (alphabetic words only)
- TF-IDF vectorization using `ngram_range=(1,2)` and `max_features=5000`

## ðŸ§® Sentiment Mapping

| Score | Sentiment |
|-------|-----------|
| 1â€“2   | Negative  |
